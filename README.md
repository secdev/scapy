# Scapy #

Scapy is a powerful Python-based interactive packet manipulation
program and library.

It is able to forge or decode packets of a wide number of protocols,
send them on the wire, capture them, match requests and replies, and
much more.

It can easily handle most classical tasks like scanning, tracerouting,
probing, unit tests, attacks or network discovery (it can replace
hping, 85% of nmap, arpspoof, arp-sk, arping, tcpdump, tethereal, p0f,
etc.). It also performs very well at a lot of other specific tasks
that most other tools can't handle, like sending invalid frames,
injecting your own 802.11 frames, combining technics (VLAN hopping+ARP
cache poisoning, VOIP decoding on WEP encrypted channel, ...),
etc.

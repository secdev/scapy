Modified:
  - def arpcachepoison():
    - Added opcode argument with default value of 'who-has'
      - Higher likelihood of success per https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-15/dc15-presentations/dc-15-d_aguanno.pdf --> Slide 21
    - Added direction argument for Targeted scenario allowing arp to go both ways
    - Added iFace argument allowing user to set specific NIC
       - Useful when arping your own box because otherwise you become ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff.....

Modified:
  - def arpcachepoison():
    - Changed docstring to more clearly explain what's going on
    - Added a broadcast method to where a specific target is not needed
      - Allows user to target the whole subnet
    - Switched original opcode for targeted attack to use ARP Reply -vs- ARP Request
      - "who-has" --> "is-at"
    - Changed default interval from 60 to 3


Recommendations:
  ** Concern:  Might break pre-existing projects
  - class ARP():
    - Switch ShortEnumField 1 and 2 to match the Opcode field translation
      - "who-has":1 --> ARP-req:1
      - "is-at":2   --> ARP-rep:2

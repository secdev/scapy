This folder includes source files (text and graphics) for Scapy's documentation,
which is automatically built using Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>

The *.rst files are written as reStructuredText and should be quite readable
in your favourite text editor without any further formatting.

To generate much nicer, searchable HTML docs, install Sphinx, open a command 
line, change to the directory where this README is placed, and type the
following command:

  $ make html

To generate a single PDF file (useful for printing) you need a working
LaTeX installation (e.g. <http://www.tug.org/texlive/>). 
The following commands produce the file Scapy.pdf (>100 pages):

  $ make latex
  $ cd _build/latex
  $ make all-pdf
